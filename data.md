# Haps App Data Deletion Guide

### Introduction

At Haps App, we believe in your right to control your personal data. 
This guide will assist you in understanding how you can delete your account or modify the data you've provided us.

### How to Delete Your Data
1. **Delete Your Account:** If you wish to delete all your data, you can delete your user account in the app. 
This action will permanently remove all data associated with your account, including your email, password, display name, 
profile picture, and all recorded activity.

2. **Change Your Profile Picture:** If you want to change your profile picture, you can do so in the app by editing your profile. 
Changing the picture will overwrite the existing one.

3. **Change Your Username:** You can also change your username at any time by editing your profile in the app. 
You have the option to leave the username field blank if you prefer.

* Email
